\subsection{Luminosity measurement}



\subsection{Run I dataset}

The recording of proton-proton collisions during run I of the LHC has been incredibly 
successful. In 2010, an integrated luminosity of \unit{45}{\invpb} was recorded at a 
centre-of-mass energy \unit{$\sqrt{s} = 7$}{\TeV}. However, this data was not used in the 
analysis and will not be referred to later.

	section of \unit{71.5}{\milli\barn} at \unit{$\sqrt{s} = 7$}{\TeV} and 
	\unit{73.0}{\milli\barn} at \unit{$\sqrt{s} = 8$}{\TeV}.}
