ATLAS is a general purpose particle detector designed to probe hadron-hadron collisions, 
from precise measurements of \ac{SM} predictions to searches for new physics.
As such, it was designed to achieve a good performance in the reconstruction of all 
physics objects interacting with the detector (electrons, muons, photons and jets), and 
to infer the existence of non-interacting particles through transverse momentum imbalance.
A good vertex resolution was needed for jet flavour tagging and the high pile-up 
environment expected at the \ac{LHC}. Other requirements included a fast trigger system 
to select interesting events to record.
%, and the ability to function in an environment with large radiation doses.

The design of ATLAS exhibits cylindrical and forward-backward symmetries with the nominal 
interaction point at the centre.\footnote{
	ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal 
	interaction point. The $x$-axis points to the centre of the \ac{LHC} ring, the 
	$y$-axis points upwards, and the $z$-axis points along the beam line. Positions and 
	directions within the detector are given in spherical coordinates $(r, \theta, \phi)$ 
	where $r$ is the radial distance, $\theta$ is the polar angle and $\phi$ is the 
	azimuthal angle. Usually the polar angle is converted to pseudorapidity 
	$\eta = -\ln\tan(\theta/2)$. The distance between two positions in $\eta\mhyphen\phi$ 
	space is $\Delta R = \sqrt{\Delta\eta^2 + \Delta\phi^2}$.
	Observables labelled ``transverse'' are projected into the $x\mhyphen y$ plane.
} 
The three detector sub-systems (tracking, calorimetry and the muon spectrometer) 
follow a consistent design of a central barrel with end-caps at both ends, giving a high 
degree of hermeticity (see \Figure~\ref{fig:atlas_whole}). Barrel components are arranged 
on concentric cylinders around the beam axis, while end-cap components are on disks 
perpendicular to the beam axis.

\end{figure}

\Figure~\ref{fig:atlas_wedge} shows how different particles interact with the various 
parts of the detector. Next to the beam pipe is the inner detector which precisely tracks 
the trajectories of charged particles. Then there are the electromagnetic and hadronic 
calorimeters which absorb and measure the energy of interacting particles. Since muons are
minimum ionising particles, they survive the calorimeters and are tracked by the muon 
spectrometer. Superconducting solenoid and toroid magnets provide magnetic fields to the 
inner detector and muon spectrometer respectively, allowing the momenta of charged 
particles to be measured from the curvature of their tracks.

\subsection{Tracking}

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=0.44\textwidth]{tex/experiment/id_wedge}
	\caption{The ATLAS inner detector: (left) cut-away view and (right) cross-sectional

	The beam pipe has radius \unit{29}{\milli\metre}.}
	\label{fig:inner_detector}
\end{figure}

Pattern recognition algorithms are used to precisely track the trajectories of charged 
particles through the \ac{ID}, shown in \Figure~\ref{fig:inner_detector}. The \ac{ID} is 
immersed in a \unit{2}{\tesla} solenoidal magnetic field, which enables the momentum of a 
particle to be measured from the curvature of its track. Momentum and vertex measurements
both require an excellent spatial resolution, which is achieved through fine detector 
granularity. The \ac{ID} covers the region $\mods{\eta} < 2.5$ and consists of three 
complementary sub-detectors:
\begin{description}
\item[Pixel detector] \hfill \\
	The pixel detector is installed in three layers closest to the beam pipe, and 
	therefore requires the highest granularity to deal with the large particle fluxes.
	It consists of more than 80 million silicon pixels, each of size 
	\unit{$50 \times 400$}{\micro\metre\squared} and thickness \unit{250}{\micro\metre}. 
	The intrinsic accuracy is \unit{10}{\micro\metre}$\,\times\,$\unit{115}{\micro\metre} 
	in $r\phi \mhyphen z$ ($r\phi \mhyphen r$) space for the barrel (end-cap).

	A silicon particle detector consists of a reverse-biased p-n junction. When a charged
	particle passes through the depletion region it creates an electron-hole pair, which 
	travel to the respective electrodes and produce a signal current.
\item[\ac{SCT}] \hfill \\
	The \ac{SCT} features 15,912 silicon strip sensors, each consisting of 770 strips 
	with a pitch of \unit{80}{\micro\metre} and a length of \unit{6}{\centi\metre}. Pairs 
	of sensors are sandwiched together (forming modules) with a stereo angle of 
	\unit{40}{\milli\radian}, which enables the $z$-coordinate of the hit to be measured. 
	There are four (nine) layers of modules in the barrel (end-cap), which ensures that 
	each track passes through four modules. 
	The intrinsic accuracy is \unit{17}{\micro\metre}$\,\times\,$\unit{580}{\micro\metre} 
	in $r\phi \mhyphen z$ ($r\phi \mhyphen r$) space for the barrel (end-cap).
\item[\ac{TRT}] \hfill \\
	The \ac{TRT} features 370,000 drift chambers (straws) which simultaneously function 
	as a straw tracker to enhance particle tracking and as a transition radiation 
	detector to aid electron identification. Straws are aligned with the beam pipe in the 
	barrel and radially in the end-caps. The \ac{TRT} covers the region 
	$\mods{\eta} < 2.0$.

	Each \unit{4}{\milli\metre} diameter straw has a 
	Kapton\textsuperscript{\circledR}\xspace wall with a conductive coating, which 
	acts as a cathode at \unit{$-1530$}{\volt}, and a central tungsten wire anode. The 
	straws are filled with a xenon-based gas mixture that is ionised by a traversing 
	charged particle. The freed electrons drift to the anode and produce a signal current.
	The drift time is used to measure the impact parameter of the incident charged 
	particle relative to the anode and, since a track typically traverses 36 straws, this 
	collective information yields an intrinsic accuracy of \unit{130}{\micro\metre} in 
	$r\phi$ (much smaller than the straw diameter). However, tracking information 
	parallel to the straw is lost.

	The layers of straws are interleaved with polypropylene radiator fibres or foils, and 
	the changes in refractive index cause charged particles to emit X-ray transition 
	radiation (TR). The TR is absorbed by the xenon gas in the straws; TR signals are 
	distinguished from tracking signals with a higher threshold. Since the probability of 
	TR is proportional to the particle's $\gamma$-factor, for a given energy lighter 
	particles produce more TR than heavier particles. This aids electron-pion 
	discrimination.
\end{description}




\subsection{Calorimetry}

Particle energies are measured with sampling calorimeters, which consist of alternating 
layers of absorber and active material. The dense absorber causes energy deposition 
via a particle shower, whilst the active material produces a signal proportional to the 
sampled energy. The length scale of energy loss is the radiation length $X_0$ for 
electrons and photons\footnote{
	High-energy electrons (photons) mostly lose energy in matter by bremsstrahlung 
	(\epluseminus pair production). In this regime, $X_0$ is (a) the mean distance in 
	which an electron loses all but $\eexp{-1}$ of its energy, (b) $\tfrac{7}{9}$ of the 
	mean free path of a photon, and (c) the characteristic scale of electromagnetic 
	showers.
} and the nuclear interaction length $\lambda$ for hadronic showers\footnote{
	Hadrons lose energy in matter through inelastic hadronic interactions, forming hadronic showers (though neutral pions create electromagnetic showers). $\lambda$ is 
	(a) the mean free path of a hadron, and (b) the characteristic scale of hadronic showers.
}, while muons act as minimum ionising particles and escape the calorimeters. Since 
punch-through into the muon system must be minimised, $X_0$ and $\lambda$ set the size of 
the calorimeter. Conversely, limits to detector size constrain the materials that can be
used.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\largefigwidth]{tex/experiment/calo_whole}
	\caption{Cut-away view of the ATLAS calorimeter system \cite{ATLAS-detector}.}
	\label{fig:calorimeters}
\end{figure}

The ATLAS calorimeter consists of an inner electromagnetic calorimeter (for electrons and 
photons) and an outer hadronic calorimeter (for jets), as shown in 
\Figure~\ref{fig:calorimeters}. They cover the regions $\mods{\eta} < 3.2$ and 
$\mods{\eta} < 4.9$ respectively.
\begin{description}
\item[\ac{ECal}] \hfill \\
	The \ac{ECal} uses a lead absorber and a liquid argon (LAr) active material arranged 
	in an accordion geometry, which ensures uniform $\phi$-coverage. The LAr is ionised 
	by charged particles, and the freed electrons produce a signal current in the readout 
	electrodes. LAr was chosen for its linear behaviour, stability and radiation-hardness.

	A fine granularity is required to make precise electron and photon measurements, and 
	to distinguish single photons from $\HepProcess{\Ppizero \HepTo \Pphoton \Pphoton}$. 
	Thus, the \ac{ECal} is typically segmented into three layers with a minimum 
	$\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi$ granularity of $0.025/8 \times 0.025$. The transition 
	between the barrel and the end-cap, $1.37 < \mods{\eta} < 1.52$, is used for detector 
	services. Since this material is difficult to model, this ``crack'' region is usually 
	excluded when reconstructing electrons.
\item[\ac{HCal}] \hfill \\
	The \ac{HCal} consists of a tile calorimeter covering $\mods{\eta} < 1.7$, a Hadronic 
	End-Cap (HEC) covering $1.5 < \mods{\eta} < 3.2$, and a Forward Calorimeter (FCal) 
	covering $3.1 < \mods{\eta} < 4.9$. The \ac{HCal} has a coarser granularity than the
	\ac{ECal} - it is typically segmented into three layers with a minimum 
	$\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi$ granularity of $0.1 \times 0.1$.

	The tile calorimeter uses a steel absorber and scintillator tiles as the active 
	material. The scintillation light is collected by optical fibres and turned into a 
	signal by photomultiplier tubes. The HEC and FCal both use LAr active material.
	However, the HEC uses a copper absorber, whereas the FCal uses copper in the first 
	layer (for electromagnetic measurements) and tungsten in the two subsequent layers.
\end{description}




\subsection{Muon spectrometer}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\mediumfigwidth]{tex/experiment/ms_whole}
	\caption{Cut-away view of the ATLAS muon spectrometer \cite{ATLAS-detector}.}
	\label{fig:muon_spectrometer}
\end{figure}

The \ac{MS} provides precision tracking of muons that have exited the calorimeters. A 
huge air-core toroid magnet system generates a \unit{0.5}{\tesla} (\unit{1}{\tesla}) 
field in the barrel (end-caps), enabling momentum measurements from track curvature. Four 
types of tracking chamber are installed in three layers around the calorimeters (see 
\Figure~\ref{fig:muon_spectrometer}):
\begin{description}
\item[\acp{MDT} and \acp{CSC}] \hfill \\
	\acp{MDT} and \acp{CSC} provide precision momentum measurement, with a resolution of 
	about \unit{40}{\micro\metre} in the bending plane. \acp{MDT} cover the region 
	$\mods{\eta} < 2.7$, but in the forward region ($2.0 < \mods{\eta} < 2.7$), the 
	innermost layer is replaced with \acp{CSC} to withstand the higher particle flux. 
	\acp{CSC} are multiwire proportional chambers with cathode planes segmented into 
	strips in orthogonal directions.
\item[\acp{RPC} and \acp{TGC}] \hfill \\
	\acp{RPC} and \acp{TGC} provide less precise tracking, but at a faster readout speed 
	needed for triggering. They also provide a coordinate in the direction 
	orthogonal to that provided by the \acp{MDT} and \acp{CSC}. \acp{RPC} cover 
	$\mods{\eta} < 1.05$ and \acp{TGC} cover $1.05 < \mods{\eta} < 2.7$.
	\acp{RPC} are gas-filled parallel plate detectors operated in avalanche mode.
	\acp{TGC} are multiwire proportional chambers operated in a quasi-saturated mode.
\end{description}




\subsection{Trigger and data acquisition}

It is technically infeasible to record the detector readout (\unit{1.6}{\mega\bel} per 
event) at the bunch crossing rate expected at the \ac{LHC} (\unit{40}{\mega\hertz}).
Moreover, the majority of these events are uninteresting in terms of the \ac{LHC} physics 
program. For these reasons, ATLAS has a trigger system to identify and retain interesting
events for further analysis offline.

The trigger is split into three levels: \ac{L1}, \ac{L2} and the \ac{EF}. These have 
successively lower event rates, which is achieved by affording later levels a longer
latency to apply more refined selection criteria, as shown in \Figure~\ref{fig:trigger}.
The \ac{L2} and \ac{EF} triggers are collectively referred to as the \ac{HLT}, and are
implemented on an off-detector computer farm.
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{tex/experiment/trigger}
	\caption{Schematic diagram of the ATLAS trigger and data acquisition (DAQ) system.
	Typical values for event rates, data rates and trigger latencies during the 2012 run 
	are taken from \cite{TriggerNumbers}.}
	\label{fig:trigger}
\end{figure}

The \ac{L1} trigger searches for high-$p_T$ leptons, photons and jets, in addition to 
events with significant total transverse energy or transverse energy imbalance. The 
decision is made using muon trigger chamber information (\acp{RPC} and \acp{TGC}) and 
reduced-granularity calorimeter information. Since the decision latency 
(\unit{2.5}{\micro\second}) is longer than the bunch spacing (\unit{25}{\nano\second}),
the \ac{L1} trigger stores event data in pipelines.

The detector coordinates of interesting features identified by the \ac{L1} trigger, known 
as Regions of Interest (ROIs), are passed on to the \ac{L2} trigger. The \ac{L2} trigger 
then requests the full degree of detector information for these ROIs (\about 2\% of total
event data), in order to make a more informed decision. Finally, the \ac{EF} trigger has
access to the full event data, and further reduces the data rate such that it can be 
written to tape.
