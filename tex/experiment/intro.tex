The ATLAS experiment is a general purpose particle detector operated by a collaboration of 
more than 3000 scientists. It was designed to search for a broad range of new phenomena by 
precisely studying the collisions of high energy protons, which are provided by the 
\ac{LHC} accelerator at CERN, Geneva.

The \ac{LHC} accelerator is described in \Section~\ref{sec:lhc}, followed by a description 
of the ATLAS detector in \Section~\ref{sec:atlas}. Finally, the dataset which was 
used in this thesis is described in \Section~\ref{sec:dataset}.
