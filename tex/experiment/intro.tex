The ATLAS experiment is a general-purpose particle detector operated by an international 
collaboration of more than 3000 scientists. It is designed to search for a broad range of 
new phenomena by precisely studying the collisions of high energy protons, which are 
provided by the \ac{LHC} accelerator at CERN, Geneva.

The \ac{LHC} and the \pp collision data it provides are described in \Section~\ref{sec:lhc}
and \Section~\ref{sec:dataset} respectively. Then, the ATLAS detector is described in
\Section~\ref{sec:atlas}.
