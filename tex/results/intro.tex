Chapters~\ref{chap:selection}--\ref{chap:backgrounds} describe the details of the \HWW 
analysis: the selection of signal events and the rejection of backgrounds, and how each 
process is modelled. By comparing the expected and observed events passing the 
selection criteria, with a careful treatment of statistical and systematic uncertainties, it 
is possible to make statistically meaningful statements about the \HWW process, based upon 
the Run~I dataset.

\Section~\ref{sec:systematics} briefly summarises the experimental and theoretical sources 
of systematic uncertainty. Then, \Section~\ref{sec:stats} describes the statistical 
treatment used to extract the experimental results, which are finally presented in  
\Section~\ref{sec:results}.
