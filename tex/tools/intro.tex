Although the search for the Higgs boson is motivated by the electroweak interaction, a
detailed knowledge of \ac{QCD} is required to make precise predictions at a hadron-hadron
collider such as the \acs{LHC}. The science of calculating such experimentally verifiable
predictions is known as phenomenology, and this chapter will introduce some of the tools
used in this thesis.
