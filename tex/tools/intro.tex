Although the search for the Higgs boson is motivated by the electroweak interaction, a
detailed knowledge of \ac{QCD} is required to make precise predictions at a hadron-hadron
collider such as the LHC. However, such calculations are troublesome -- \ac{QCD} describes 
the interactions of quarks and gluons, though only hadrons are experimentally observed.

Some key concepts of \ac{QCD} are introduced in \Section~\ref{sec:qcd}, before the 
simulation of LHC collisions is described in \Section~\ref{sec:mc}. Finally, jets are 
introduced in \Section~\ref{sec:jets} as useful tools connecting theoretical calculations 
with experimental observations.
