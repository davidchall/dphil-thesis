Although the search for the Higgs boson is motivated by the electroweak interaction, a
detailed knowledge of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is required to make precise predictions 
at a hadron collider such as the LHC. However, these calculations are troublesome; QCD 
describes the interactions of quarks and gluons, though only the composite hadrons are 
experimentally observed.

Some key concepts of QCD are introduced in \Section~\ref{sec:qcd}, before the 
simulation of LHC collisions is described in \Section~\ref{sec:mc}. Finally, jets are 
introduced in \Section~\ref{sec:jets} as useful tools connecting theoretical calculations 
with experimental observations.
