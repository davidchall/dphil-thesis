Background modelling is of paramount importance to the \HWW search. As an irreducible 
background, continuum \WWlvlv production dominates the 0-jet and 1-jet bins, where the 
majority of the sensitivity lies. Thus, even a small uncertainty in this background can 
have a large effect on the uncertainty in the measured signal. The process is also of general 
interest to electroweak phenomenology and is sensitive to anomalous triple gauge couplings 
(aTGCs), as seen in \Figure~\ref{fig:WW:feyn}.

\Section~\ref{sec:ww_meas} describes a dedicated \WW cross section measurement performed 
using the 2011 dataset of \pp collisions at \unit{$\sqrt{s} = 7$}{\TeV}. Then, 
\Section~\ref{sec:ww_as_bkg} describes how the \WW background is estimated in the phase 
space of the \HWW search.
