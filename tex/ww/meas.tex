This section describes the \WW cross section measurement using the 
\unit{$\sqrt{s} = 7$}{\TeV} dataset, published in \Reference~\cite{WW-7TeV}.
As the experimental signature is the same as \HWW, many aspects are shared.
However, there are two key differences between the analyses: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The analysis described in \Chapter~\ref{chap:selection} is optimised for low 
	mass (\unit{$\mH \approx 125$}{\GeV}) resonant \WW production. It therefore requires 
	at least one \PW boson to be off-shell, and consequently employs low lepton \pt 
	thresholds (\unit{$\pt > 10$}{\GeV}). Conversely, the measurement of non-resonant \WW 
	production is optimised for on-shell \PW bosons, and raises the lepton thresholds 
	to \unit{$\pt > 20$}{\GeV}. This reduces hadrons misidentified as leptons, and obviates 
	the need to split the different-flavour channel into \emch/\mech.

	\item The total \WW cross section at \unit{$\sqrt{s} = 7$}{\TeV} is 
	\unit{$\sigma_{\text{NLO}} = 44.7^{+2.1}_{-1.9}$}{\pico\barn}, which is much larger than 
	that of \ggHWW (\unit{$3.3 \pm 0.4$}{\pico\barn} for \unit{$\mH = 125$}{\GeV}). This 
	enables backgrounds to be suppressed by tighter criteria, whilst retaining a large 
	number of signal events. As an example, only the 0-jet bin is used.
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Reconstruction of physics objects}

Beam conditions in 2011 were quite different to 2012; in particular, the pile-up 
environment was considerably less harsh (see \Figure~\ref{fig:dataset:pileup}). Consequently, 
the reconstruction of physics objects is slightly different to that described in 
\Section~\ref{sec:objects}:

\begin{description}
\item[Electrons] \hfill \\
	The Gaussian Sum Filter was not implemented in the 2011 reconstruction, and so the 
	efficiency is lower (see \Figure~\ref{fig:objects:el_recoeff}). To reduce fakes, the 
	cut-based \textit{tight} identification criteria are used. The reduced pile-up allows
	tighter calorimeter isolation to be applied, $\etcone{0.3}/\et < 0.14$, and this in 
	turn allows for looser tracker isolation $\ptcone{0.3}/\et < 0.13$. Finally, the 
	association with the primary vertex is relaxed, with the transverse impact parameter 
	$d_0$ required to be within ten standard deviations of zero. The \pt threshold is raised 
	to \unit{20}{\GeV}.

\item[Muons] \hfill \\
	Differences to muon reconstruction are minimal. Slightly tighter quality criteria are 
	applied to the ID tracks. The isolation criteria are $\etcone{0.3}/\pt < 0.14$ and 
	$\ptcone{0.3}/\pt < 0.15$. The \pt threshold is raised to \unit{20}{\GeV}.

\item[Jets] \hfill \\
	A lower pile-up noise threshold is used in topo-clustering, corresponding to 
	$\mu = 8$ (\cf $\mu = 30$ in 2012). Local cluster weighting (LCW) is not performed on 
	topo-clusters, and so jets are corrected directly from the EM scale to the Jet Energy 
	Scale (JES). In 2011, the pile-up subtraction step of the calibration is less 
	sophisticated, and is averaged over \npv and $\mu$ rather than an event-by-event 
	correction \cite{Jets:PileupCorrection:2011}. The jet vertex fraction criterion is also 
	removed. A unified \pt threshold of \unit{25}{\GeV} is used over the entire 
	range $\mods{\eta} < 4.5$.

\item[Missing transverse momentum] \hfill \\
	Calorimeter-based \met is used exclusively throughout the analysis.

\end{description}



\subsection{Event selection criteria}

As mentioned above, the event selection of the \WW measurement can be tighter than that 
of the \HWW search, and does not require such stringent optimisation.

\begin{description}
\item[Data quality] \hfill \\
	The 2011 \pp dataset (see \Section~\ref{sec:dataset:dataset}) is subject to data 
	quality criteria as in 2012, though some criteria are specific to the data-taking 
	conditions of 2011. The selected dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 
	\unit{$4.64 \pm 0.18$}{\invfb}.

\item[Trigger] \hfill \\
	The lowest unprescaled single lepton triggers were used to support 
	\unit{$\ptleadlep > 25$}{\GeV} in the offline analysis, whilst operating on the 
	plateau. These changed throughout the year as beam conditions changed, and 
	are displayed in \Table~\ref{tab:ww:triggers}.

\item[Event selection] \hfill \\
	The event selection is shown in \Table~\ref{tab:ww:sel} and is similar to the 0-jet 
	\HWW selection in \Table~\ref{tab:event_selection}, although the topological cuts of 
	the Higgs boson decay are obviously not applied. The major differences are the raised 
	lepton thresholds, the raised \met cuts, and the lack of \dphillmet and \frecoil cuts.

\subsection{Analysis strategy}
\label{sec:ww:strategy}

In contrast to the \HWW search, the signal region of the \WW measurement has a high 
signal-to-background ratio. Thus, it is sufficient to simply count the number of events 
passing the selection, rather than fit a discriminating observable like \mt.

In order to measure the total \WW cross section, it is necessary to estimate the signal 
acceptance of the event selection (see \Section~\ref{sec:ww:signal}). This extrapolation 
from the measured phase space to the inclusive phase space introduces theoretical 
uncertainties. It is helpful to separate these theoretical uncertainties from the others, 
by measuring an intermediate cross section in a \textit{fiducial region} of phase space, 
chosen to be similar to that used in the detector-level selection in order to minimise 
the extrapolation.

The fiducial region is defined by the criteria in \Table~\ref{tab:ww:sel} applied to 
hadron-level objects, which are now described. The MC event record is used to identify 
prompt leptons and neutrinos. An \truthmetvec vector is constructed 
from the neutrinos. Each lepton is `dressed' by adding the four-momenta of photons within a 
cone of $\Delta R < 0.1$, in order to recover energy lost via QED FSR. Jets are found 
using particle four-momenta as inputs (\cf topo-clusters at detector-level). Muons and 
neutrinos are excluded from jet finding since they interact weakly with the calorimeter. 
Objects must pass the same \pt, $\eta$ and overlap-removal criteria applied at 
detector-level.

The fiducial cross section is extracted from measurements using
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{\WW}^{\text{fid}} = \frac{N_{\text{obs}} - N_{\text{bkg}}}{C_{\WW} \cdot L}
	\label{eq:ww:fid_xs}
\end{equation}
where $N_{\text{obs}}$ is the observed number of events passing the event selection, 
$N_{\text{bkg}}$ is the expected number of background events (see 
\Section~\ref{sec:ww:bkg}), $L$ is the luminosity of the dataset, and $C_{\WW}$ is the 
ratio of the expected number of signal events passing the detector-level selection to 
those passing the fiducial selection. $C_{\WW}$ accounts for detector effects such as 
trigger and reconstruction efficiencies, and object mismeasurement due to the 
finite resolution of the detector.

The total cross section can be extracted using
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{\WW} = \frac{N_{\text{obs}} - N_{\text{bkg}}}{C_{\WW} \cdot A_{\WW} \cdot \text{BR} \cdot L}
	\label{eq:ww:total_xs}
\end{equation}
where $A_{\WW}$ is the ratio of the expected number of signal events passing the fiducial 
selection to the total expected number of signal events. $A_{\WW}$ accounts for the 
signal acceptance of the event selection criteria. BR incorporates the branching ratios 
of both \PW bosons for the channel in question, and includes contributions from leptonic 
\Ptau decays.

It is apparent from (\ref{eq:ww:fid_xs}) and (\ref{eq:ww:total_xs}) that both signal and 
background modelling are important inputs in measuring a cross section.



\subsection{Signal modelling}
\label{sec:ww:signal}

The \WW process is modelled at NLO by \meps{\mcatnlo}{\fherwig}. The NNLO \ggWW diagrams 
contribute \about3\% to the total cross section, due to the large gluon luminosities at 
the LHC, and are modelled by \meps{\ggtoww}{\fherwig} \cite{gg2ww}. The signal 
acceptances $C_{\WW}$ and $A_{\WW}$ are corrected for the small mismodelling of trigger and 
lepton reconstruction efficiencies, through \textit{in situ} tag-and-probe studies (see 
\Section~\ref{sec:objects:electrons}).

The jet veto in the event selection is responsible for the dominant uncertainties in both 
$C_{\WW}$ and $A_{\WW}$. Uncertainties in the jet energy scale (JES) and jet energy 
resolution (JER) lead to large uncertainties in $C_{\WW}$, since the leading jet \pt is a 
rapidly falling distribution. As discussed in \Section~\ref{sec:ggf_jetbin}, restricting 
QCD emissions via a jet veto introduces large theoretical uncertainties to $A_{\WW}$, 
though these are expected to be smaller in \WW than in ggF since the perturbative 
corrections are smaller.

For these reasons, a data-driven correction factor is included within $C_{\WW}$ in order to 
improve the modelling of the jet veto acceptance $\epsilon_{\WW}$. This correction 
factor is derived using \HepProcess{\PZ \HepTo \Plepton \Plepton} events. Thus, the 
predicted jet veto acceptance is
\begin{equation}
	\epsilon^{\text{pred}}_{\WW} = \epsilon^{\text{MC}}_{\WW} \cdot \frac{\epsilon^{\text{data}}_{\PZ}}{\epsilon^{\text{MC}}_{\PZ}} \,.
\end{equation}
Application of this correction factor effectively calibrates the MC generator to data 
(thus the same MC generator must be used to model $\epsilon^{\text{MC}}_{\WW}$ and 
$\epsilon^{\text{MC}}_{\PZ}$). As shown in 
\Table~\ref{tab:ww:jetveto_contrib}, this enables the experimental uncertainty in the 
jet veto acceptance to be reduced, at the expense of introducing a theoretical 
uncertainty to $C_{\WW}$. However, in the product $C_{\WW} \cdot A_{\WW}$ the 
theoretical uncertainty is also reduced.

Correction factors $\epsilon^{\text{data}}_{\PZ} / \epsilon^{\text{MC}}_{\PZ}$ are 
measured in control regions with high \HepProcess{\PZ \HepTo \Plepton \Plepton} purity. 
Events are selected with \unit{$\ptleadlep > 25$}{\GeV}, \unit{$\ptsubleadlep > 20$}{\GeV}
and \unit{$\mods{\mll - \mZ} < 15$}{\GeV} in the \eech and \mmch channels. The correction 
factor for the \emch channel is taken as the average of the other two. The correction 
factors are 0.957, 0.954 and 0.956 for the \eech, \mmch and \emch channels respectively. 
Statistical uncertainties are negligible compared to the experimental and theoretical 
uncertainties.

	\label{tab:ww:jetveto_contrib}
\end{table}

Uncertainties in $\epsilon^{\text{MC}}_{\WW}$ and $\epsilon^{\text{MC}}_{\PZ}$ due to the 
JES are evaluated by increasing and decreasing jet energies by one standard deviation, 
and using the average of the absolute deviations. The JES uncertainty is determined during 
the \textit{in situ} calibration \cite{Jets:Calib:2011}. Similarly, uncertainties due to the 
JER are evaluated by increasing the JER by one standard deviation. The JER uncertainty is 
determined using other \textit{in situ} techniques \cite{Jets:JER:2011}. These 
uncertainties are displayed in \Table~\ref{tab:ww:jetveto_unc}.

Theoretical uncertainties are evaluated at hadron-level by changing some aspect of the MC 
modelling and measuring the effect upon the jet veto acceptance $\epsilon$. These 
uncertainties are 
displayed in \Table~\ref{tab:ww:jetveto_unc}, and their estimation is described below.

Uncertainties due to higher order corrections are evaluated using the combined inclusive 
method described in \Section~\ref{sec:ggF:ci}. The renormalisation and factorisation 
scales are independently varied in the range $\mu_0/2 \leq \mur,\muf \leq 2\mu_0$, where 
$\mu_0$ is the default scale for the process in question\footnote{
	The default scales used by \mcatnlo are determined by 
	$\mu_0^2 = m_{\Plepton\Plepton}^2 + p_{\text{T,\HepProcess{\Plepton\Plepton}}}^2$ 
	for \PZ production and 
	$\mu_0^2 = (m_{\Plepton\Pnu}^2 + p_{\text{T,\HepProcess{\Plepton\Pnu}}}^2 + 
	m_{\Plepton'\Pnu'}^2 + p_{\text{T,\HepProcess{\Plepton'\Pnu'}}}^2) / 2$
	for \WW production.
}, whilst observing the constraint $1/2 \leq \mur/\muf \leq 2$. The largest deviation is 
used as the uncertainty.

\end{table}

Uncertainties due to parton distribution functions (PDFs) are evaluated in two ways, and 
added in quadrature. The jet veto acceptance predicted with the CT10 PDF is compared to that 
predicted with the MSTW2008 PDF \cite{MSTW}. The set of PDF eigenvectors corresponding 
to 90\% CL of the CT10 fit are also used.

Uncertainties due to the parton shower (PS), hadronisation and underlying event (UE) 
models are evaluated by recomputing the jet veto acceptances with \powhegbox events, and 
comparing the result when showered by \fherwig and by \pythia{6}.

By substituting uncertainties from \Table~\ref{tab:ww:jetveto_unc} into the two 
strategies outlined in \Table~\ref{tab:ww:jetveto_contrib}, it is clear that the jet veto 
correction factor offers a significant reduction in uncertainty. Considering the 
$\sigma_{\WW}$ extraction from the \emch channel, the contribution of the experimental 
uncertainty in $\epsilon_{\WW}$ reduces from 5.1\% to 0.7\%, while the theoretical 
uncertainty reduces from 5.6\% to 3.5\%. However, it does introduce a theoretical 
uncertainty to $\sigma^{\text{fid}}_{\WW}$ of 2.6\%.

The signal acceptances $A_{\WW}$, $C_{\WW}$ and $C_{\WW} \cdot A_{\WW}$ are displayed in 
\Table~\ref{tab:ww:cww_aww}. The \mmch channel has the best reconstruction efficiency and 
the event selection of the \emch channel has the highest yield. The uncertainties arising 
from different systematic sources are also shown, with those associated with the jet veto 
separated for clarity. The JES and JER uncertainties in the jet veto acceptance 
are approximated to be uncorrelated with those of the other cuts. The same is true of the 
theoretical uncertainties in $A_{\WW}$.

\subsection{Background modelling}
\label{sec:ww:bkg}

The background estimation techniques of the \HWW search are more sophisticated than those 
of the \WW measurement at \unit{$\sqrt{s} = 7$}{\TeV}. For this reason, the techniques 
used in the \WW measurement are only described briefly here, whereas those of the \HWW 
search shall be discussed in detail in \Section~\ref{sec:ww_as_bkg} and 
\Chapter~\ref{chap:backgrounds}.

Although many backgrounds are modelled by a data-driven technique, there is often some 
underlying dependence upon MC. For this reason, \Table~\ref{tab:ww:mc_samples} states the 
MC generators used to model each process.

\begin{table}[t]

\end{table}

\newpage
\begin{description}
\item[\Wjets and dijet] \hfill \\
	The \Wjets background comprises events where a jet is misidentified as a lepton. The 
	rate of misidentification, or ``fake rate'', is poorly modelled by MC, and so a 
	data-driven \textit{fake factor method} is used. The dijet background, where two jets 
	fake leptons, is very small and is simultaneously estimated by this method.

	A \Wjets anti-ID region (AR) is defined similarly to the signal region (SR), but 
	where one of the leptons is replaced with an anti-identified lepton, \antiid{\Plepton}. 
	The \antiid{\Plepton} objects are ensured to be highly contaminated with jets by 
	loosening the selection criteria and vetoing leptons passing the full identification. 
	Anti-ID electrons, \antiid{\Pe}, have looser calorimeter isolation criteria and do not 
	have to pass the \textit{tight} identification criteria. Anti-ID muons, \antiid{\Pmu}, 
	have looser calorimeter isolation criteria and the tracker isolation removed completely. 
	The predicted \Wjets background is the measured number of events in the AR, scaled by a 
	fake factor 
	$f_{\Plepton}$:
	\begin{equation}
		N_{\text{\Wjets}}^{\text{pred,SR,\HepProcess{\Pe\Pe}}} &= f_{\Pe} \cdot N^{\text{data,AR}}_{\id{\Pe}\antiid{\Pe}} \\
		N_{\text{\Wjets}}^{\text{pred,SR,\HepProcess{\Pmu\Pmu}}} &= f_{\Pmu} \cdot N^{\text{data,AR}}_{\id{\Pmu}\antiid{\Pmu}} \\
		N_{\text{\Wjets}}^{\text{pred,SR,\HepProcess{\Pe\Pmu}}} &= f_{\Pe} \cdot N^{\text{data,AR}}_{\id{\Pmu}\antiid{\Pe}} + f_{\Pmu} \cdot N^{\text{data,AR}}_{\antiid{\Pmu}\id{\Pe}} \,.
	\end{equation}
	The fake factor $f_{\Plepton}$ is defined as the ratio of efficiencies for jets passing 
	the lepton ID criteria to jets passing the anti-ID criteria. Each fake factor is 
	measured from dijet events as a function of \pt and $\eta$:
	\begin{equation}
		f_{\Plepton} = \frac{N_{\id{\Plepton}}^{\text{data}}}{N_{\antiid{\Plepton}}^{\text{data}}} \,.
	\end{equation}
	To avoid bias, the dijet events were selected with a very loose (but prescaled) 
	trigger, without identification or isolation criteria applied. A \PZ veto 
	(\unit{$\mods{\mll - \mZ} > 15$}{\GeV}) and a \PW veto (\unit{$\mt > 30$}{\GeV}) 
	reject most of the prompt leptons, and residual electroweak contamination is subtracted 
	using MC.

	The dominant source of uncertainty stems from the fact that the fake factor is 
	derived from dijet events but applied to \Wjets events. This process dependence is 
	estimated with MC. It would be preferable to measure the fake factor from \Zjets 
	events, though this was statistically limited in the \unit{$\sqrt{s} = 7$}{\TeV} 
	dataset. This point shall be revisited in \Section~\ref{sec:wjets} when considering 
	the \Wjets background to the \HWW search.

\item[Top] \hfill \\
	The top background is suppressed by the jet veto, and its yield is estimated by a 
	data-driven \textit{template method}. This constrains the top \njets distribution within 
	a \Pbottom-tagged control region (CR), subtracting contamination via a data-driven 
	template fit. Then the 0-jet yield is extrapolated from the CR to the SR using MC.

	In detail, an extended signal region (ESR) is defined by removing the jet veto and the 
	\ptll cut. The top CR is a subset of the ESR, requiring at least one \Pbottom-tagged jet 
	with \unit{$\pt > 20$}{\GeV}. The top \njets distribution, $\mathcal{T}$, in the ESR is 
	predicted by measuring $\mathcal{T}$ in the CR and extrapolating using MC:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{T}_{\text{top}}^{\text{pred,ESR}} = \frac{\mathcal{T}_{\text{top}}^{\text{MC,ESR}}}{\mathcal{T}_{\text{top}}^{\text{MC,CR}}} \parenths{\mathcal{T}^{\text{data,CR}} - K_{\text{non-top}}^{\text{fit}} \cdot \mathcal{T}_{\text{non-top}}^{\text{MC,CR}}} \,.
	\end{equation}
	The non-top contamination in the CR is described by MC and scaled by a data-driven 
	normalisation factor $K_{\text{non-top}}^{\text{fit}}$. This 
	$K_{\text{non-top}}^{\text{fit}}$ is assumed to be the same in the CR and the ESR, 
	and is constrained by an \njets fit in the ESR, \ie
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{T}^{\text{data,ESR}} = \mathcal{T}_{\text{top}}^{\text{pred,ESR}} + K_{\text{non-top}}^{\text{fit}} \cdot \mathcal{T}_{\text{non-top}}^{\text{MC,ESR}} \,.
	\end{equation}
	Note that this fit depends upon $K_{\text{non-top}}^{\text{fit}}$ twice: directly and 
	via $\mathcal{T}_{\text{top}}^{\text{pred,ESR}}$. The fit yields 
	$K_{\text{non-top}}^{\text{fit}} = 1.07 \pm 0.03$. Finally, the 0-jet bin of 
	$\mathcal{T}_{\text{top}}^{\text{pred,ESR}}$ is extrapolated to the SR using MC.

	The small number of 0-jet events in the top CR leads to a large statistical 
	uncertainty in this background. The systematic uncertainty is dominated by 
	uncertainties in the (mis)tag efficiency of the \Pbottom-tagging algorithm.

\item[\DY] \hfill \\
	The \DY background is suppressed by the \PZ mass veto and the \calometrel and \ptll 
	cuts, though remains a significant background to the \eech and \mmch channels. Since MC 
	might mismodel the \calometrel distribution in \DY events, this background is normalised 
	to data in a control region (CR) that includes the \calometrel cut.

	The \DY CR is defined similarly to the signal region (SR), with the \ptll cut 
	inverted. The number of events in the CR is measured, the non-\DY contamination is 
	subtracted via MC, and the result is extrapolated to the SR using MC:
	\begin{equation}
		N_{\text{\DY}}^{\text{pred,SR}} = \frac{N_{\text{\DY}}^{\text{MC,SR}}}{N_{\text{\DY}}^{\text{MC,CR}}} \parenths{N^{\text{data,CR}} - N_{\text{non-\DY}}^{\text{MC,CR}}} \,.
	\end{equation}

	The dominant uncertainties are due to the small number of events in the CR and the 
	energy scale of the soft terms in the \calometrel (see \Section~\ref{sec:objects:met}).

\item[Non-\WW diboson] \hfill \\
	The non-\WW diboson backgrounds (\WZ, \Wgstar, \ZZ, \Wgamma) are estimated purely 
	from MC simulation (see \Table~\ref{tab:ww:mc_samples}). The cross section of each 
	process is calculated at NLO with \mcfm \cite{MCFM:VV}.  The dominant uncertainties are 
	theoretical uncertainties in the cross section and JES uncertainties in the jet veto.

\subsection{Experimental results}
\label{sec:ww:results}

The observed and expected \ptleadlep and \dphill distributions in the signal region are 
displayed in \Figure~\ref{fig:ww_meas:sr_plots}, and the observed number of events passing 
the event selection is shown for each channel in 
\Table~\ref{tab:ww:sr_yield}. The expected number of events is also shown, with the 
signal and background contributions estimated as described in 
Sections~\ref{sec:ww:signal} and \ref{sec:ww:bkg}, respectively. Systematic uncertainties 
in the \DY and non-\WW diboson backgrounds are considered correlated (since they are both 
dominated by uncertainties in the calorimeter energy scale), and those in the other 
backgrounds are considered uncorrelated. A comparison of data to expectation suggests that 
the measured cross section shall be higher than predicted.

	\label{tab:ww:sr_yield}
\end{table}

The fiducial and total cross sections are calculated for each channel with 
(\ref{eq:ww:fid_xs}) and (\ref{eq:ww:total_xs}) respectively, using the values in 
Tables~\ref{tab:ww:cww_aww} and \ref{tab:ww:sr_yield} and an integrated luminosity of 
\unit{$L = 4.64 \pm 0.18$}{\invfb}. Systematic uncertainties in the signal acceptance and 
the total background estimation are assumed uncorrelated, and propagate to the cross 
sections via
\begin{equation}
	\parenths{\frac{\Delta\sigma^{\text{fid}}_{\WW}}{\sigma^{\text{fid}}_{\WW}}}_{\text{\!syst}}^{\!2} &= \parenths{\frac{\Delta C_{\WW}}{C_{\WW}}}^{\!2} \!+ \parenths{\frac{\Delta N_{\text{bkg}}}{N_{\text{obs}} - N_{\text{bkg}}}}^{\!2} \!+ \parenths{\frac{\Delta L}{L}}^{\!2} \label{eq:ww:fid_syst} \\
	\parenths{\frac{\Delta\sigma_{\WW}}{\sigma_{\WW}}}_{\text{\!syst}}^{\!2} &= \parenths{\frac{\Delta \parenths{C_{\WW} \cdot A_{\WW}}}{C_{\WW} \cdot A_{\WW}}}^{\!2} \!+ \parenths{\frac{\Delta N_{\text{bkg}}}{N_{\text{obs}} - N_{\text{bkg}}}}^{\!2} \!+ \parenths{\frac{\Delta L}{L}}^{\!2} \,. \label{eq:ww:total_syst}
\end{equation}
The relative statistical uncertainty in each channel is simply 
$\sqrt{N_{\text{obs}}} / \parenths{N_{\text{obs}} - N_{\text{bkg}}}$.

The combined total cross section from the three channels is obtained by maximising the 
likelihood function of a Poisson process
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}\parenths{\sigma_{\WW} \vert N_{\text{obs}}^{\emch}, N_{\text{obs}}^{\eech}, N_{\text{obs}}^{\mmch}} &= \Pois{N_{\text{obs}}^{\emch}; \sigma_{\WW}} \cdot \Pois{N_{\text{obs}}^{\eech}; \sigma_{\WW}} \cdot \Pois{N_{\text{obs}}^{\mmch}; \sigma_{\WW}} \nonumber \\
	&= \prod\limits_{i=1}^3 \frac{\eexp{-\parenths{N_{\text{sig}}^i + N_{\text{bkg}}^i}} \cdot \parenths{N_{\text{sig}}^i + N_{\text{bkg}}^i}^{N_{\text{obs}}^i}}{N_{\text{obs}}^i!}
\end{equation}
where $N_{\text{sig}}^i = \sigma_{\WW} \cdot C_{\WW}^i \cdot A_{\WW}^i \cdot \text{BR}^i 
\cdot L$ and the product over $i$ corresponds to the three channels. The best fit 
$\hat{\sigma}_{\WW}$ is that which maximises the likelihood, and the statistical 
uncertainty is obtained by finding where $\ln \mathcal{L}(\hat{\sigma}_{\WW} \pm 
\Delta\sigma_{\WW}) = \ln \mathcal{L}(\hat{\sigma}_{\WW}) - \tfrac{1}{2}$. 

The systematic uncertainty in the combined cross section is calculated with
(\ref{eq:ww:total_syst}), again using the values in Tables~\ref{tab:ww:cww_aww} and 
\ref{tab:ww:sr_yield}. The top and non-\WW diboson systematic uncertainties are 
considered correlated between all three channels (since the \Pbottom-tagging efficiency, JES 
and total diboson cross sections are independent of lepton flavour). The \Wjets and \DY 
systematic uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated between the \eech and \mmch channels, 
though the \eech{}+\mmch combination is considered correlated with the \emch channel (since 
the $f_{\Pe}$ and $f_{\Pmu}$ fake factors are determined independently, and the \DYll 
uncertainty is related to lepton energy mismeasurement).

The measured cross sections are shown in \Table~\ref{tab:ww:xs_results}. The combined total 
cross section is \statsystlumi{51.9}{2.0}{3.9}{2.0}~\pico\barn, which is slightly higher 
than the theoretical prediction of \unit{$44.7\pm2.0$}{\pico\barn}. However, the discrepancy 
is not significant. If contributions from \HWW and VBF \WW production are included as 
backgrounds, the 
measured cross section reduces to \statsystlumi{50.5}{2.0}{3.9}{2.0}~\pico\barn.
