Non-resonant \WW production is an irreducible background to the \HWW search, and is the 
dominant background contribution following the event selection described in 
\Chapter~\ref{chap:selection}. Thus, it is critical that it is accurately estimated. 

The \WW process is modelled at NLO by \meps{\powhegbox}{\pythia{6}}. It is necessary to 
use \powhegbox since \mcatnlo does not feature ``singly resonant diagrams'', where the 
mass of the dilepton + dineutrino system is that of a single \PW boson. Since the \HWW 
search is sensitive to off-shell \PW bosons, it is important to include these diagrams. 
The \pythia{6} event generator is used as it is found to better describe the 
experimental data in many exclusive observables, when compared to \pythia{8}. This is likely to be related to the \meps{\powhegbox}{\pythia{8}} matching issues mentioned in 
\Section~\ref{sec:ggF:meps_matching}. Also, the ATLAS underlying event AUET2B tune 
\cite{ATLAS:tune:2011} was found to be overtuned to dijet data and consequently its 
description of electroweak processes suffered. For this reason, the updated Perugia 2011C 
\pythia{6} tune \cite{PerugiaTunes} was used. NNLO \ggWW diagrams are modelled by 
\meps{\ggtoww}{\fherwig} \cite{gg2ww}.

To estimate the \WW contribution to the signal region (SR), a data-driven technique is 
employed whereby MC is used to extrapolate from a high-purity control region (CR) to the SR:
\begin{equation}
	N_{\WW}^{\text{pred,SR}} &= \alpha_{\WW} \cdot \parenths{N^{\text{data,CR}} - N_{\text{non-\WW}}^{\text{pred,CR}}} \label{eq:ww_bkg1} \\
	\alpha_{\WW} &= N_{\WW}^{\text{MC,SR}} / N_{\WW}^{\text{MC,CR}} \label{eq:ww_bkg2}
\end{equation}
where $N_{\text{non-\WW}}^{\text{pred,CR}}$ is determined by dedicated methods (see 
\Chapter~\ref{chap:backgrounds}). The CR is optimised to reduce 
$N_{\text{non-\WW}}^{\text{pred,CR}}$ to avoid bias, whilst maintaining a large 
$N_{\WW}^{\text{data,CR}}$ to minimise the statistical uncertainty in 
$N_{\WW}^{\text{pred,SR}}$. The MC-based extrapolation $\alpha_{\WW}$ introduces experimental 
and theoretical uncertainties to $N_{\WW}^{\text{pred,SR}}$.

As explained in \Section~\ref{sec:selection:higgs_decay}, the resonant \HWW and 
non-resonant \WW processes are distinguished by the scalar nature of the Higgs boson, 
which affects the decay topology of the \PW bosons. This causes \HWW events to have a 
small dilepton opening angle, and consequently low \mll and \dphill. It is therefore 
intuitive to define the \WW CR at high \mll, with a relaxed \dphill requirement.

Since jet binning can introduce large uncertainties, a \WW CR is defined for each of the 
0-jet and 1-jet bins separately. Unfortunately, it is not possible to define a \WW CR in 
the \twojet bin with sufficient purity owing to the large top background. Thus, the \WW 
background estimation in the \twojet bin is MC-based (see \Section~\ref{sec:ww_bkg:2j}).

	\label{tab:ww_cr_sel}
\end{table}

The event selection criteria of the \WW CRs are outlined in \Table~\ref{tab:ww_cr_sel}. Since 
the \eech/\mmch channels are dominated by \DYll, they are extrapolated from \emch/\mech CRs. 
The selection criteria follow those of the SRs (see \Table~\ref{tab:event_selection}), with 
different \mll and \dphill cuts. However, the \ptsubleadlep threshold is raised from 
\unit{10}{\GeV} to \unit{15}{\GeV} in order to reduce contamination from the \Wjets 
background. A validation region (VR) is also defined in the 0-jet bin with 
\unit{$\mll > 110$}{\GeV}, to test the extrapolation from the CR.

To estimate the \WW background in regions other than the SRs and VR, the method is viewed as 
providing a simple data-driven normalisation factor. This is equivalent to neglecting the 
extrapolation uncertainties, but is helpful when plotting observables. The normalisation 
factors are measured to be \stat{1.22}{0.03} in the 0-jet bin and \stat{1.06}{0.05} in the 
1-jet bin\todo{update}. \Figure~\ref{fig:ww_bkg:cr_plots} exhibits the excellent description 
of experimental data in the CRs, following application of the normalisation factors.

\subsection{Theoretical uncertainties in $\alpha_{\WW}$}
\label{sec:ww_bkg:alpha}

Theoretical uncertainties in the extrapolation parameters $\alpha_{\WW}$ are evaluated 
at hadron-level (\ie before detector simulation) by changing some aspect of the MC 
modelling and measuring the effect upon each $\alpha_{\WW}$. This is done using NLO \WW 
MC. Uncertainties due to \ggWW diagrams are negligible, since these diagrams only 
contribute \about5\% (\about7\%) to the 0-jet (1-jet) bin SRs.

The hadron-level event selection criteria used to evaluate these uncertainties are similar to 
the detector-level criteria of the SRs (see \Table~\ref{tab:event_selection}) and CRs (see 
\Table~\ref{tab:ww_cr_sel}), except the \Pbottom-jet veto and \frecoil cuts are omitted.

Hadron-level object definitions follow. The MC event record is used to identify leptons 
and neutrinos which descend from the \PW bosons. An \metvec vector is constructed from 
the neutrinos. Each lepton is `dressed' with the four-momenta of photons within a cone of 
$\Delta R < 0.1$, in order to recover energy lost via QED FSR. Jets are found using 
individual particles as inputs (\cf topo-clusters at detector-level). Muons and neutrinos 
are excluded from jet finding since they interact weakly with the calorimeter. Objects 
must pass the same \pt, $\eta$ and overlap removal criteria applied at detector-level.

Four sources of theoretical uncertainty are considered:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
	\item higher order corrections,
	\item PDFs,
	\item parton shower, hadronisation and underlying event models,
	\item NLO-PS matching scheme.
\end{itemize}

Uncertainties due to higher order corrections are evaluated via independent variation of 
renormalisation and factorisation scales in the range $\mu_0/2 \leq \mur,\muf 
\leq 2\mu_0$, where $\mu_0 = m_{\HepProcess{\Plepton\Pnu\Plepton'\Pnu'}}$, whilst observing 
the constraint $1/2 \leq \mur/\muf \leq 2$. These are evaluated with \amcatnlo and validated 
with \mcfm. The largest deviation is used as the uncertainty.

Uncertainties due to PDFs are evaluated in two ways. Predictions with the MSTW 2008 
\cite{MSTW} and NNPDF 2.3 \cite{NNPDF} PDF sets are compared to those with the CT10 
\cite{CTEQ} PDF sets, and the maximum deviation is found. Also, the set of PDF 
eigenvectors corresponding to 90\% CL of the CT10 fit were used to evaluate an 
uncertainty, which was then rescaled to 68\% CL. These are evaluated using \amcatnlo.

Uncertainties due to the PS, hadronisation and UE models are evaluated by 
comparing \powhegbox showered by \pythia{6} (nominal) and by \fherwig. 
Uncertainties due to the NLO-PS matching scheme are evaluated by comparing 
\meps{\powhegbox}{\fherwig} to \meps{\amcatnlo}{\fherwig}.

The $\alpha_{\WW}$ theoretical uncertainties for each SR used in the fitting procedure are 
shown in \Table~\ref{tab:ww_bkg:alpha_unc} (experimental uncertainties are discussed in 
\Chapter~\ref{chap:results}). Those for the VR are also shown. 
The expected number of events in the validation region is \statsyst{123}{1}{1}, whilst the 
observed number is 123\todo{update}. This agreement supports the extrapolation uncertainties 
assigned to the SRs.

\subsection{\mt shape modelling}
\label{sec:ww_bkg:mt}

Theoretical uncertainties in the shape of the \mt distribution are also investigated, 
as they could affect the fit. Uncertainties due to scale, PS/UE and NLO-PS choices are 
considered within each signal region separately, using the methods described above.

Each uncertainty is parametrised by fitting the ratio of the \mt shapes, and then 
symmetrising the fit to produce ``up'' and ``down'' variations. The \mt distributions are 
normalised to unit integral in order to probe only shape uncertainties. A linear 
fit is used in the central \mt region, and a constant is used in the low-\mt and 
high-\mt tails of the distribution where statistical fluctuations dominate.

These fits allow the hadron-level \mt distribution of the \WW background to be reweighted 
to the ``up'' and ``down'' variations. In this way, the \mt shape uncertainty is treated 
as a nuisance parameter in the \HWW fitting procedure (see \Chapter~\ref{chap:results}). 
The uncertainties for the split signal regions of the \emch/\mech channels are displayed in 
Figures~\ref{fig:ww_bkg:mTshape_0j} and \ref{fig:ww_bkg:mTshape_1j} for the 0-jet and 1-jet 
bins, respectively.

\end{figure}



\subsection{\WW background in the \twojet bin}
\label{sec:ww_bkg:2j}

\powhegbox relies upon the parton shower to produce the second emission; consequently events 
with two or more hard jets are likely to be poorly modelled. For this reason, \sherpa is used 
to describe the \WW background in the \twojet bin, including up to three partons in the 
matrix element using LO ME-PS merging (see \Section~\ref{sec:mc:merging}).

Two kinds of diagrams 
can be identified for the \WW~+~2~jets process: electroweak production (with zero QCD 
vertices at LO) and QCD production (with two QCD vertices at LO), where VBF \WW 
production is included in the former. 

The two production types are simulated separately at LO by \sherpa, and this causes their 
interference to be neglected. Interference with VBF Higgs boson production diagrams is 
also neglected. The effect of each interference is investigated and treated as a 
systematic uncertainty.
