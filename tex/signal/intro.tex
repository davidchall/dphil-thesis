Signal and background modelling is of utmost importance when designing a search strategy; 
differences can be exploited to optimise the sensitivity. Whereas background modelling can 
often be experimentally verified (and in some cases estimated by entirely data-driven 
methods), the signal processes must rely purely upon theoretical models.

The analysis described in \Chapter~\ref{chap:selection} is designed to search for the 
ggF production mode (see \Figure~\ref{fig:sig:ggF}), which exhibits large 
theoretical uncertainties. \Section~\ref{sec:ggf_inc} briefly outlines the current 
knowledge of the inclusive ggF cross section. The significant theoretical issues 
introduced by jet vetoes are considered in \Section~\ref{sec:ggf_jetbin}. Uncertainties 
related to the MC modelling of ggF are discussed in \Section~\ref{sec:ggf_mc}.
