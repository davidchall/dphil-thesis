For a particle to be considered ``discovered'' within the particle physics community, 
the null hypothesis must be rejected with $\geq\!5\sigma$ significance, 
corresponding to $<0.0001\%$ chance that the observation is a statistical fluctuation.
In the summer of 2012, this level of significance was reached independently by the ATLAS 
and CMS collaborations, primarily driven by searches for \HepProcess{\PHiggs \HepTo 
\Pphoton\Pphoton} and \HepProcess{\PHiggs \HepTo \PZ\PZ} and supported by the \HWW search 
\cite{ATLAS-discovery,CMS-discovery}. Both experiments observed a resonance at 
\unit{$m \approx 125$}{\GeV}.

This observation was quickly corroborated by \HepProcess{\PV\PHiggs \HepTo 
\PV\Pbottom\APbottom} searches performed by the CDF and \dzero experiments at the Tevatron, 
which yielded consistent results with $3.1\sigma$ combined significance 
\cite{Tevatron:2012}.

Using the entire Run I dataset, the significance of the particle discovery was extended 
by the ATLAS experiment to $7.4\sigma$ in \HepProcess{\PHiggs \HepTo \Pphoton\Pphoton} 
\cite{ATLAS:combination:2013}, $6.6\sigma$ in \HepProcess{\PHiggs \HepTo \PZ\PZ} 
\cite{ATLAS:combination:2013}, and $5\sigma$\todo{update} in \HWW (see 
\Chapter~\ref{chap:results}). Focus inevitably shifted to measuring its properties (mass, 
couplings, spin, parity) in order to test the hypothesis that it is a Higgs boson.
Observations confirm this hypothesis, though more precise measurements are required to 
ascertain whether or not it is the Higgs boson predicted by the SM.



\subsection{Mass measurement}
\label{sec:searches:mass}

The mass of the Higgs boson, \mH, is unpredicted by the SM, and is very important to 
measure precisely. Once \mH is known, all the Higgs boson couplings, production cross 
sections and branching ratios can be calculated (see \Section~\ref{sec:properties}). The 
value of \mH is also important when assessing the theoretical implications of the 
discovery (see \Section~\ref{sec:implications}).

The \HepProcess{\PHiggs \HepTo \Pphoton\Pphoton} and \HepProcess{\PHiggs \HepTo \PZ\PZ} 
decay channels offer the best sensitivity to \mH, since they exhibit very clean 
experimental signatures and allow full reconstruction of the Higgs boson four-momentum.
Combining these two channels gives an \mH measurement of 
\unit{\statsyst{125.5}{0.2}{0.6}{}}{\GeV} in ATLAS \cite{ATLAS:combination:2013} and 
\unit{\statsyst{125.7}{0.3}{0.3}{}}{\GeV} in CMS \cite{CMS:mass}. These are in excellent 
agreement, although some tension exists between the two ATLAS channels. The Higgs boson is 
as heavy as an atom of caesium-133.

A Higgs boson with \unit{$\mH \approx 126$}{\GeV} is fortuitous, 
since many different production modes and decay channels should be experimentally 
accessible at the LHC (see Figures~\ref{fig:higgs_xs} and \ref{fig:higgs_br}). In 
particular, couplings to both bosons and fermions can be measured, directly testing the 
two types of mass generation the Higgs field is responsible for in the SM.



\subsection{Coupling measurements and limits}
\label{sec:searches:couplings}

Coupling strengths of the Higgs boson to other SM particles are probed by searching for 
different experimental signatures, which correspond to specific combinations of 
production mode and decay channel. For example, the \WH production mode with the \HWW 
decay mode is sensitive only to the \HepProcess{\PHiggs\PW\PW} coupling. On the other 
hand, the ggF production mode and the \HepProcess{\PHiggs \HepTo \Pphoton\Pphoton} decay 
channel feature loops, and interpreting results in terms of couplings is less 
straightforward. Undiscovered massive particles may contribute to such loops, distorting 
the effective couplings to gluons and photons.

Measurements of \HepProcess{\PHiggs \HepTo \Pphoton\Pphoton}, \HepProcess{\PHiggs \HepTo 
\PZ\PZ}, \HWW and \HepProcess{\PHiggs \HepTo \Ptau\Ptau} were made with the Run I 
dataset, with signal regions optimised for ggF and VBF production. A measurement of 
\HepProcess{\PV\PHiggs \HepTo \PV\Pbottom\APbottom} was also made. Assuming SM couplings, 
the measured cross sections can be expressed as a signal strength $\mu = 
\sigma_{\text{meas}} / \sigma_{\text{SM}}$. The signal strengths measured with the ATLAS 
experiment are consistent with the SM predictions, as shown in \Figure~\ref{fig:concl:mu}.
Similar measurements were made with the CMS detector, also yielding signal strengths 
compatible with the SM \cite{CMS:Hgamgam,CMS:HZZ,CMS:HWW,CMS:Htautau,CMS:Hbb}.

\begin{figure}[t]

	\caption{Measured signal strength (\unit{$\mH = 125.5$}{\GeV}) for each final state 
	\cite{ATLAS:couplings:Moriond14}. Combinations of bosonic, fermionic and all decay 
	channels are also shown. The \HWW result is from a previous analysis of the Run~I 
	dataset, before the final sensitivity optimisation described in this thesis.}
	\label{fig:concl:mu}
\end{figure}

It is also informative to split the signal strength according to the production mode. 
\Figure~\ref{fig:concl:mu_2D} shows the likelihood contours for a fit with two signal 
strength parameters: one for production modes dominated by a fermionic coupling (ggF and 
\ttH), and the other for modes dominated by a bosonic coupling (VBF and \VH). Again, this 
assumes the couplings themselves are those predicted by the SM, but it is useful 
to see which analyses are sensitive to which types of couplings. It is clear that \HWW is 
a very sensitive analysis for coupling measurements.

\begin{figure}[t]
	\includegraphics[width=\largefigwidth]{tex/conclusions/atlas_mu_2D}
	\caption{Likelihood contours of measured signal strength (\unit{$\mH = 125.5$}{\GeV}) 
	for each final state \cite{ATLAS:couplings:Moriond14}. Signal strengths are split 
	according to the dominant coupling in the production mode: fermionic (ggF and \ttH) 
	or bosonic (VBF and \VH). The \HWW result is from a previous analysis of the Run~I 
	dataset.}
	\label{fig:concl:mu_2D}
\end{figure}

These measurements were used to test specific coupling scenarios in 
\Reference~\cite{ATLAS:couplings:Moriond14}, and no significant deviations from the SM 
were observed. The two most generic scenarios are highlighted here. 

The first scenario assumes a SM particle content. The probed couplings are free 
parameters in the fit, and are expressed as coupling scale factors: 
$\kappa_{\PZ}, \kappa_{\PW}, \kappa_{\Ptop}, \kappa_{\Pbottom}, \kappa_{\Ptau}$. The 
\HepProcess{\PHiggs\Pphoton\Pphoton} and \HepProcess{\PHiggs\Pgluon\Pgluon} effective 
couplings and the total width are then calculated within the framework of the SM, as 
functions of the $\kappa_i$. Compatibility with the SM is $p = 0.13$ (see 
\Figure~\ref{fig:concl:couplings:SM}), with differences driven by the 
\HepProcess{\PHiggs \HepTo \Pbottom\APbottom} result.

The second scenario allows for undiscovered particles, which may contribute through loops 
or to the total width. Thus, two effective coupling scale factors are introduced 
($\kappa_{\Pphoton}, \kappa_{\Pgluon}$), and the absence of a total width constraint 
means that only coupling ratios can be probed. The free parameters of the fit are 
$\lambda_{\Pphoton\PZ}, \lambda_{\PW\PZ}, \lambda_{\Pbottom\PZ}, \lambda_{\Ptau\PZ}, 
\lambda_{\Pgluon\PZ}, \lambda_{\Ptop\Pgluon}, \kappa_{\Pgluon\PZ}$ where 
$\lambda_{ij} = \kappa_i / \kappa_j$, $\kappa_{ij} = \kappa_i \cdot \kappa_j / 
\kappa_{\PHiggs}$ and $\kappa_{\PHiggs}$ is the scale factor of the total width. 
Compatibility with the SM is $p = 0.21$ (see \Figure~\ref{fig:concl:couplings:BSM}). The 
large uncertainty on $\lambda_{\Ptop\Pgluon}$ could be improved by a measurement of the 
\ttH production mode.

In addition to the five measured channels described above, upper bounds on rare decay 
channels have also been set by ATLAS. The observed limits at \unit{$\mH = 125$}{\GeV} are 
$\sigma < 11\sigma_{\text{SM}}$ for \HepProcess{\PHiggs \HepTo \PZ\Pphoton} 
\cite{ATLAS:HZgam} and $\sigma < 10\sigma_{\text{SM}}$ for \HepProcess{\PHiggs \HepTo 
\Pmu\Pmu} \cite{ATLAS:Hmumu}, at the 95\% CL. Also, a search for \HepProcess{\ZH \HepTo 
\Plepton\Plepton\met} constrained the branching ratio to invisible particles to 
$< 75\%$ at the 95\% CL, assuming $\sigma = \sigma_{\text{SM}}$ and 
\unit{$\mH = 125$}{\GeV} \cite{ATLAS:Hinv}. Such a limit is important because 
undiscovered massive particles that interact weakly (\eg dark matter) could 
enhance the invisible width $\Gamma_{\text{inv}}$. Slightly tighter limits have been set by 
the CMS collaboration \cite{CMS:HZgam,CMS:Hmumu,CMS:Hinv}.



\subsection{Spin and parity measurement}
\label{sec:searches:spin}

The SM Higgs boson is a spin-0 and CP-even particle, \ie $J^P = 0^+$. To establish that 
the observed particle is the Higgs boson, it is important to experimentally confirm these 
properties. According to the Landau-Yang theorem, the spin-1 hypothesis is excluded by 
the observation of \HepProcess{\PHiggs \HepTo \Pphoton\Pphoton} 
\cite{Landau:1948,Yang:1950}. Since there may be coincident resonances, this hypothesis is 
tested by the other channels.

The $J^P$ was probed by considering the decay topologies of events in the 
\HepProcess{\PHiggs \HepTo \PZ\PZ}, \HWW and \HepProcess{\PHiggs \HepTo \Pphoton\Pphoton} 
measurements with ATLAS. However, some event selection criteria were altered with respect 
to the coupling measurements, in order to improve sensitivity. For example, the \HWW 
selection exploits the spin-0 hypothesis through the \unit{$\mll < 55$}{\GeV} and 
$\dphill < 1.8$ criteria (see \Section~\ref{sec:selection:higgs_decay}).

The $0^-, 1^+, 1^-, 2^+$ hypotheses are excluded at greater than 97.8\% CL, whilst the 
data are compatible with the $0^+$ hypothesis \cite{ATLAS:spin}. This provides strong 
evidence that the discovered particle is spin-0, and is the only observed fundamental 
scalar particle. It could be a mixture of CP-even and CP-odd states, though a preference 
for CP-even is observed.
