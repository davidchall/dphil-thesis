\subsection{Hierarchy problem}

\subsection{Vacuum stability problem}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \Section~\ref{sec:prior_constraints:theory}
	\item At critical boundary for vacuum stability, $\lambda$ and $\beta_{\lambda}$ are very close to zero. Inflation models might be possible using the Higgs boson as the inflaton. Therefore very important to measure Higgs self-coupling (\eg di-Higgs production)
\end{itemize}

Electroweak fits, tensions
125 GeV => Fortunate to measure many decay channels
