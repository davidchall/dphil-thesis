This thesis has described the experimental search for the \ggHWWlvlv process of Higgs boson 
production and decay. It uses the LHC Run~I dataset of \pp collisions recorded by the ATLAS 
detector, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of \unit{4.5}{\invfb} at 
\unit{$\sqrt{s} = 7$}{\TeV} and \unit{20.3}{\invfb} at \unit{$\sqrt{s} = 8$}{\TeV}. 
An excess of events is observed with a significance of 4.8 standard deviations ($4.8\sigma$), 
which is consistent with Higgs boson production. The significance is extended to $6.1\sigma$ 
when the vector boson fusion production process is included. According to the convention 
adopted by the particle physics community, this constitutes a first observation, or 
discovery, of this process. The observed resonance is found to be consistent with the Higgs 
boson of the Standard Model with \unit{$\mH = 125$}{\GeV}, as are results from other LHC 
search channels described in \Section~\ref{sec:searches}.

The best-fit signal strength at \unit{$\mH = 125$}{\GeV} is found to be 
$\hat{\mu} = 1.11 \pm 0.22$, in excellent agreement with the Standard Model expectation. With 
a precision of 20\%, this \HWW analysis is the most sensitive $\mu$ measurement of the LHC 
Run~I Higgs boson analyses \cite{ATLAS:Hgg:RunI,ATLAS:HZZ:RunI,CMS:Hgamgam,CMS:HZZ,CMS:HWW}. 
It will take some years to improve upon this precision at Run~II of the LHC. With the 
expected Run~II dataset of \unit{100}{\invfb} at \unit{$\sqrt{s} = 13\text{ -- }14$}{\TeV}, 
the statistical uncertainty should be reduced -- dramatically so for $\mu_{\text{VBF}}$. 
The larger dataset should also afford more sophisticated background estimation techniques to 
be employed, \eg using same-sign events to model the normalisation \textit{and} shape of the 
non-\WW diboson background, in order to reduce the associated theoretical uncertainties. 
Finally, advances in theoretical calculations and MC event generators shall improve the 
estimation of processes with large theoretical uncertainties (\eg ggF and \WW).
