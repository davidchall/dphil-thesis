The first theory of weak interactions was a four-point interaction with Fermi coupling 
\unit{$G_F = 1.166\times 10^{-5}$}{\GeV\rpsquared}. Although successful in describing low energy phenomena, such as nuclear $\beta$-decay, at high energies the theory predicted cross sections which violate unitarity at $E \gtrsim \unit{300}{\GeV}$ 
\cite{Aitchison}.

The solution was to introduce charged vector bosons (\PWpm bosons) to mediate the weak 
interaction, similar to the exchange of photons in \ac{QED}. However, unlike \ac{QED}, 
the weak interaction is short ranged and therefore its exchange bosons must be massive. 
Since the propagator for a particle of mass $m$ and momentum $p$ contains 
$1 / (p^2 - m^2)$, in the low energy limit we can identify that
\begin{equation}
	G_F \sim g^2 / m_{\PW}^2 ,
\end{equation}
where $g$ is the coupling of the vector boson. Thus, at low energies, the strength of the weak interaction is suppressed by the mass of the exchange boson.

At this time, there were two key obstacles to unifying the electromagnetic and weak 
interactions into a single interaction. Firstly, following the experimental discovery of 
parity violation in the $\beta$-decay of cobalt-60 \cite{Wu:1957}, the weak interaction
was known to have a \VminusA structure whereas \ac{QED} has a pure V structure. 
Secondly, the weak interaction has massive gauge bosons whilst the photons of \ac{QED} are 
massless. This was a major problem because gauge bosons are inherently massless.\footnote{
	Consider the local gauge transformation of a Yang-Mills gauge field 
	$\bvec{W}^{\mu} \rightarrow \bvec{W}^{\mu} - \partial^{\mu} \bvec{\epsilon}(x)
	- g \lbrack \bvec{\epsilon}(x) \times \bvec{W}^{\mu} \rbrack$. Clearly the mass term 
	$-\tfrac{1}{2}m^2 \bvec{W}_{\mu} \cdot \bvec{W}^{\mu}$ is not gauge invariant, and 
	hence the gauge boson is massless.}
In fact, the chiral nature of the weak interaction forbids fermion masses too, which are
also experimentally observed.\footnote{
	Consider a spinor as the sum of its left- and right-handed chiral states 
	$\psi = \psi_L + \psi_R$. Then the Dirac mass term is $-m \bar{\psi} \psi = 
	-m (\bar{\psi}_R \psi_L + \bar{\psi}_L \psi_R)$. For a chiral theory, $\psi_L$ and
	$\psi_R$ behave differently under local gauge transformation and thus the mass term is not gauge invariant.
}

A major step was taken by Glashow in the proposal of an \EWgroup group 
\cite{Glashow:1961}. This model describes three gauge fields 
\rowthreevec{W^1_{\mu}}{W^2_{\mu}}{W^3_{\mu}} which couple to weak isospin $T$ with 
strength $g$, and a single gauge field $B_{\mu}$ which couples to weak hypercharge $Y$ 
with strength $g'$. The subscript `$L$' indicates that only left-handed chiral particles 
couple to the $W^i_{\mu}$ fields, explaining the \VminusA nature of the weak interaction. 
The physical gauge fields are obtained through the mixing of these fields
\begin{align}
	W^{\pm}_{\mu} &= (W^1_{\mu} \mp i W^2_{\mu}) / \sqrt{2} \label{eq:Wfield} \\
	A_{\mu} &= \sin\theta_W W^3_{\mu} + \cos\theta_W B_{\mu} \label{eq:Afield} \\
	Z_{\mu} &= \cos\theta_W W^3_{\mu} - \sin\theta_W B_{\mu} \label{eq:Zfield}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
	\cos\theta_W = g/\sqrt{g^2 + g'^2} && \sin\theta_W = g'/\sqrt{g^2 + g'^2} \label{eq:weak_mixing}
\end{align}
where $W^{\pm}_{\mu}$ give electrically charged \PWpm bosons, $A_{\mu}$ gives the photon 
and $Z_{\mu}$ gives a new neutral \PZ boson. Weak neutral currents were later confirmed 
experimentally. 

Glashow's \EWgroup theory therefore predicts the interaction of fermions, in left-handed 
\SUgroup{2} doublets and right-handed \SUgroup{2} singlets (see 
\Table~\ref{tab:ew_fermions}), with \PWpm, \PZ and \Pphoton 
exchange bosons. Gauge boson self-interactions are also expected due to the non-abelian 
nature of the \ac{EW} theory. The \PWpm bosons couple to weak isospin $T$ with strength 
$g$, the \PZ boson couples vectorially to $c_V$ and axially to $c_A$ with strength 
$g/(2\cos\theta_W)$, and the photon couples to electric charge $Q$ with strength 
$e = g\sin\theta_W$, where
\begin{align}
	c_V &= T_3 - 2 Q \sin^2\theta_W & c_A &= T_3 \\
	Q   &= T_3 + \frac{Y}{2}.
\end{align}

We have seen that the $\SUgroup{2}\times\Ugroup{1}$ symmetry must be broken, leaving 
\ac{QED} behind
\begin{equation*}
\EWgroup \xrightarrow{\text{EWSB}} \QEDgroup
\end{equation*}
Unfortunately, it was necessary to explicitly break the \ac{EW} symmetry by adding mass
terms for the \PWpm and \PZ bosons by hand. Initial attempts to invoke a mechanism of 
\ac{SSB} were hindered by the Goldstone theorem.



\subsection{The Goldstone theorem}
\label{sec:ewsb:goldstone}
\ac{SSB} arises when the vacuum state does not respect the symmetry in question. This can 
occur when a field acquires a non-zero vacuum expectation value. To see this, consider a 
complex scalar field $\phi$ described by the Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} 
	= \parenths{\partial_{\mu}\phi^{\dagger}} \parenths{\partial^{\mu}\phi} 
	+ \mu^2 \phi^{\dagger}\phi - \lambda \parenths{\phi^{\dagger}\phi}^2
	\label{eq:lagr:goldstone}
\end{equation}
with $\mu^2, \lambda > 0$ giving a sombrero potential (\Figure~\ref{fig:sombrero}).
$\mathcal{L}$ is invariant under global \Ugroup{1} transformations $\phi \rightarrow 
\eexp{-i\alpha} \phi$. There is an infinite set of degenerate vacua
$\phi = \mu\eexp{-i\theta}/\sqrt{2\lambda}$ that are not invariant under 
global \Ugroup{1} transformations, thus the symmetry is broken.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\mediumfigwidth]{tex/motivation/sombrero}
	\caption{The sombrero potential, in which a vacuum state must be arbitrarily chosen, 
	spontaneously breaking the symmetry of the underlying Lagrangian.
	Fluctuations in the azimuthal direction correspond to a massless Nambu-Goldstone 
	boson. Fluctuations in the radial direction correspond to a massive Higgs boson.}
	\label{fig:sombrero}
\end{figure}

The Goldstone theorem states that \ac{SSB} of a continuous global symmetry will lead to 
the existence of a number of massless scalar Nambu-Goldstone bosons \cite{Goldstone:1962}.
This can be seen by considering radial and azimuthal excitations, $h\parenths{x}$ and 
$\theta\parenths{x}$, about the vacuum 
\begin{equation}
	\phi\parenths{x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqbracs{v + h\parenths{x}} \eexp{-i\theta\parenths{x} / v} ,
\end{equation}
where $v = \mu/\sqrt{\lambda}$. When substituted into (\ref{eq:lagr:goldstone}), we get
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} = \tfrac{1}{2}\partial_{\mu}\theta \partial^{\mu}\theta
	+ \tfrac{1}{2}\partial_{\mu}h \partial^{\mu}h
	- \mu^2 h^2
	+ \dots
\end{equation}
where the dots denote terms neither kinetic nor mass. 
We identify a massless Nambu-Goldstone boson (the $\theta$-mode) and a Higgs boson of 
mass $\sqrt{2}\mu$ (the $h$-mode).

In order to explain massive \PWpm and \PZ bosons, the electroweak symmetry must be broken.
But the Goldstone theorem suggested that this would predict massless scalar bosons, which
were not experimentally observed.



\subsection{The Higgs mechanism}
\label{sec:ewsb:higgs}
However, when \ac{SSB} of a continuous local symmetry is studied, something remarkable 
happens. The Nambu-Goldstone bosons of the theory are `eaten' by the gauge bosons, giving 
them mass. The degrees of freedom appear as longitudinal components of the massive gauge 
bosons. This is known as the Higgs mechanism 
\cite{Englert:1964,Higgs:1964a,Higgs:1964b,Guralnik:1964,Higgs:1966}.

Consider the Lagrangian for a \Ugroup{1} gauge theory with a sombrero potential
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} 
	= \parenths{D_{\mu}\phi}^{\dagger} \parenths{D^{\mu}\phi}
	- \tfrac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}
	+ \mu^2 \phi^{\dagger} \phi - \lambda \parenths{\phi^{\dagger} \phi}^2
	\label{eq:lagr:abelHiggs}
\end{equation}
where $D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} + iqA_{\mu}$ is the covariant derivative and $F_{\mu\nu} 
= \partial_{\mu}A_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}A_{\mu}$ is the field tensor. This is invariant 
under local \Ugroup{1} transformations $\phi \rightarrow \eexp{-i\alpha\parenths{x}} \phi$
when accompanied by a gauge transformation of the potential 
$A^{\mu} \rightarrow A^{\mu} + \tfrac{1}{q}\partial^{\mu} \alpha\parenths{x}$.

We choose the unitary gauge $\alpha\parenths{x} = -\theta\parenths{x}/v$ to `gauge away' 
the $\theta$-mode. Ultimately, the final result is gauge-independent, but other choices 
make the gauge boson propagators gauge-dependent. Considering excitations about the vacuum
\begin{equation}
	\phi\parenths{x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqbracs{v + h\parenths{x}}
\end{equation}
the Lagrangian (\ref{eq:lagr:abelHiggs})) becomes
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}
	= \frac{1}{2} q^2 v^2 A_{\mu} A^{\mu}
	- F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}
	+ \frac{1}{2} \partial_{\mu}h \partial^{\mu}h
	- \mu^2 h^2
	+ \dots
\end{equation}
where the dots denote terms neither kinetic nor mass. 
The Nambu-Goldstone boson is no longer present and the photon has acquired a mass $qv$.
Again, there is a massive scalar Higgs boson as a by-product of the \ac{SSB}.

\subsection{Glashow-Salam-Weinberg electroweak theory}
The Higgs mechanism can be extended to non-abelian gauge theories, as necessary to 
describe electroweak symmetry breaking \cite{Kibble:1967,Weinberg:1967,Salam:1968}.
Consider the Lagrangian for an \SUgroup{2}\cross\Ugroup{1} gauge theory with a sombrero
potential
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} 
	= \parenths{D_{\mu}\phi}^{\dagger} \parenths{D^{\mu}\phi}
	- \tfrac{1}{4} \bvec{F}_{\mu\nu} \cdot \bvec{F}^{\mu\nu}
	- \tfrac{1}{4} G_{\mu\nu} G^{\mu\nu}
	+ \mu^2 \phi^{\dagger} \phi - \lambda \parenths{\phi^{\dagger} \phi}^2
	\label{eq:lagr:ewHiggs}
\end{equation}
where $D^{\mu} = \partial^{\mu} + \tfrac{i}{2} g \bvec{\tau} \cdot \bvec{W}^{\mu} + 
\tfrac{i}{2} g' Y B^{\mu}$ is the covariant derivative and $\bvec{F}^{\mu\nu} = 
\partial^{\mu}\bvec{W}^{\nu} - \partial^{\nu}\bvec{W}^{\mu} - g \bvec{W}^{\mu} \cross 
\bvec{W}^{\nu}$ and $G^{\mu\nu} = \partial^{\mu}B^{\nu} - \partial^{\nu}B^{\mu}$ are the
field tensors. In this case, $\phi$ is an \SUgroup{2} doublet of complex scalar fields
\begin{equation}
	\phi = \colvector{\phi^+\\\phi^0} = \colvector{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \parenths{\phi_1 + i\phi_2}\\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \parenths{\phi_3 + i\phi_4}}.
\end{equation}

Again, there are infinite degenerate vacua satisfying 
$\parenths{\phi_1^2 + \phi_2^2 + \phi_3^2 + \phi_4^2} = \mu^2/\lambda$. In analogue with 
the abelian Higgs mechanism, the unitary gauge sets the vacuum expectation values of 
$\phi_1$, $\phi_2$ and $\phi_4$ to be zero. Considering excitations about the vacuum
\begin{equation}
	\phi\parenths{x} = \colvector{0\\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
	\sqbracs{v + h\parenths{x}}} \label{eq:higgs_doublet}
\end{equation}
the Lagrangian (\ref{eq:lagr:ewHiggs}) becomes
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L} &= \tfrac{1}{8} g^2 v^2 \bvec{W}_{\mu} \cdot \bvec{W}^{\mu} - \tfrac{1}{4} \bvec{F}_{\mu\nu} \cdot \bvec{F}^{\mu\nu} + \tfrac{1}{8} v^2 g'^2 B_{\mu} B^{\mu} - \tfrac{1}{4} v^2 gg' B_{\mu} W_{3}^{\mu} - \tfrac{1}{4} G_{\mu\nu} G^{\mu\nu} \nonumber \\
	&\quad\quad {} + \tfrac{1}{2} \partial_{\mu}h \partial^{\mu}h - \mu^2 h^2 + \dots \\
	&= \tfrac{1}{4} g^2 v^2 W^{+}_{\mu} W^{-\mu} - \tfrac{1}{2} \parenths{\partial_{\mu}W^{+}_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}W^{+}_{\mu}} \parenths{\partial^{\mu}W^{-\nu} - \partial^{\nu}W^{-\mu}} \nonumber \\
	&\quad\quad {} + \tfrac{1}{8} v^2 \parenths{g^2 + g'^2} Z_{\mu} Z^{\mu} - \tfrac{1}{4} \parenths{\partial_{\mu}Z_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}Z_{\mu}} \parenths{\partial^{\mu}Z^{\nu} - \partial^{\nu}Z^{\mu}} - \tfrac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} \nonumber \\
	&\quad\quad {} + \tfrac{1}{2} \partial_{\mu}h \partial^{\mu}h - \mu^2 h^2 + \dots
\end{align}
where the dots denote terms neither kinetic nor mass, and the expression has been rewritten in terms of the physical gauge fields using (\ref{eq:Wfield}), (\ref{eq:Zfield})
and (\ref{eq:Afield}). The \PWpm bosons acquire a mass $gv/2$ and the \PZ boson acquires a
mass $v \sqrt{\parenths{g^2+g'^2}}/2$, while the photon is massless. Again, a Higgs boson
is a remnant of the \ac{SSB}.

This theory predicts a striking relation between the gauge boson masses, using 
(\ref{eq:weak_mixing})
\begin{equation}
	m_{\PW} = m_{\PZ} \cos\theta_W ,
\end{equation}
which was experimentally verified once the \PW and \PZ bosons were discovered. It also 
predicted a massive scalar Higgs boson, whose mass could not be determined from the other 
model parameters.

Fermion masses can also be incorporated into \ac{EW} theory through Yukawa couplings.
Consider a coupling between the electron-type \SUgroup{2} doublet (see 
\Table~\ref{tab:ew_fermions}), the Higgs doublet $\phi$ given in 
(\ref{eq:higgs_doublet}), and the electron \SUgroup{2} singlet
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}_{\Pe}^{\text{Yuk}} &= -g_{\Pe} \parenths{\Plepton_{\Pe L} \phi \Pe_{R} + \Pe_{R} \phi^{\dagger} \Plepton_{\Pe L}} \\
	&= -\frac{g_{\Pe}}{\sqrt{2}} \sqbracs{v + h} \parenths{\Pe_{L} \Pe_{R} + \Pe_{R} \Pe_{L}}
\end{align}
The electron has acquired a mass $g_{\Pe}v/\sqrt{2}$ and the coupling of the Higgs boson
to the electron is proportional that that mass.

Finally, we note a similar phenomenon in superconductors. There, the \Ugroup{1} symmetry 
of \ac{QED} is spontaneously broken, as in \Section~\ref{sec:ewsb:higgs}, giving mass to 
the photon and thereby producing the Meissner effect. In fact, Higgs bosons have been 
observed in the Raman spectra of superconductors. However, a major difference is that the 
bosonic field is formed of Cooper pairs of bound electrons, and therefore the \ac{SSB} is 
dynamic. It is natural to ask whether a similar dynamic mechanism could be used to break
\ac{EW} symmetry, where the Higgs boson is a composite particle. This is an active area
of theoretical research.
