The \WW decay of the Higgs boson is a promising search channel as it has a large branching 
ratio (BR) for a wide range of \mH. In fact, it is the most probable decay for 
\unit{$\mH > 135$}{\GeV} (see \Figure~\ref{fig:higgs_br}). This chapter will describe the 
experimental search for \ggHWWlvlv (where $\Plepton = \Pe, \Pmu$) using the 2012 dataset 
of \pp collisions at \unit{$\sqrt{s} = 8$}{\TeV}. The search strategy is optimised for a 
low mass Higgs boson, as favoured by electroweak fits, and thus accounts for off-shell \PW 
bosons.

The experimental signature of this search involves electrons, muons, jets and transverse 
momentum imbalance, and is 
outlined in \Section~\ref{sec:signature}. Then, \Section~\ref{sec:objects} details how 
each of these objects is reconstructed by the ATLAS detector. Finally, 
\Section~\ref{sec:selection} describes the criteria by which Higgs boson events are 
selected and background events are rejected. In doing so, it is necessary to make 
reference to many exclusive observables of signal and background processes. However, 
the modelling and estimation of these observables shall be described later, in 
Chapters~\ref{chap:signal}, \ref{chap:ww} and \ref{chap:backgrounds}.
