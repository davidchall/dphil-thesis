\subsection{Tracks}
\label{sec:objects:tracks}

A track is a sequence of hits in the \ac{ID} indicative of a charged particle trajectory. 
To first approximation the trajectories are helical, owing to the pervading solenoidal 
magnetic field. However, multiple scattering and energy losses in the detector material 
and bremsstrahlung can cause significant deviations from this path. Track reconstruction 
is possible in the region $\mods{\eta} < 2.5$ (the extent of the \ac{ID}).

The inputs to the track reconstruction are threefold: pixel hits, \acs{SCT} space-points 
(each module comprises two layers of strips with a small stereo angle, enabling precise 
coordinate measurement), and \acs{TRT} drift circles. The \textit{inside-out} algorithm 
\cite{Tracking,ATLAS:ExpectPerf} uses a Kalman filter to seed tracks from hits in the 
three pixel layers and the first \acs{SCT} layer. The seeds are then extended and fitted 
through the \acs{SCT} and the \acs{TRT}, whilst resolving ambiguities and applying 
quality criteria. Finally, the \textit{outside-in} algorithm \cite{Tracking} considers 
unused track segments in the \acs{TRT}, and extrapolates them into the \acs{SCT} and 
pixel detector. This improves the tracking of secondary particles with a displaced vertex.



\subsection{Primary and secondary vertices}
\label{sec:objects:vertices}

A vertex is a location from which at least two outgoing tracks are reconstructed. 
\textit{Primary vertices} are associated with the interactions of incoming protons, 
whereas \textit{secondary vertices} are caused by particle decay or photon conversion
(\epluseminus pair production).

Primary vertex reconstruction has two steps: association of tracks to vertices 
(\textit{vertex finding}), and reconstruction of the vertex position itself 
(\textit{vertex fitting}). ATLAS employs an iterative \textit{finding-through-fitting} 
algorithm to simultaneously perform both steps \cite{PrimVertexFinding,AllVertexFinding}.
First, tracks originating from the interaction region 
(\unit{$\Delta z \approx 5.6$}{\centi\metre} and 
\unit{$\Delta r \approx 15$}{\micro\metre}) are identified and used to seed and fit a 
single vertex. Those tracks considered outliers are then used to seed a new vertex, and a 
second fit of the two vertices is performed. The algorithm iterates, increasing the 
number of vertices, until the result stabilises.

The total number of primary vertices \npv is used to assess the pile-up conditions of 
the bunch crossing. The primary vertex of the hard scatter is chosen to be that with the 
highest $\sum p_T^2$ of the constituent tracks, and is referred to as simply \textit{the} 
primary vertex. As an additional quality criterion, this vertex must have at least three 
associated tracks.

Secondary vertex reconstruction is highly constrained by the physics of the vertex 
\cite{AllVertexFinding}. This can be enforced by mass or angular constraints, or in the 
track selection. For example, photon conversions are found using oppositely charged 
track pairs associated with electrons (using \acs{TRT} identification), with small 
opening angle. 
The \Pbottom-tagging of jets shall be described in \Section~\ref{sec:objects:bjets}.



\subsection{Electrons}
\label{sec:objects:electrons}

An electron will pass through the \ac{ID} before being absorbed by the \ac{ECal}. They 
are therefore reconstructed by matching a track with an energy cluster in the \ac{ECal}. 
Following reconstruction, the vast majority of electron objects are faked by hadrons, 
whilst many others are from photon conversions or electrons from heavy flavour decay (see 
\Figure~\ref{fig:objects:el_composition}). However, in the \HWWlvlv search, it is prompt 
electrons from the hard scatter that are of interest. Therefore identification and 
isolation criteria are applied to reject these backgrounds and select prompt electrons. 
The criteria were chosen to optimise the analysis sensitivity: \eg a low $E_T$ threshold 
of \unit{10}{\GeV} gives a large signal acceptance, but must be compensated by tight 
identification requirements to reject the large \Wjets and QCD backgrounds.

Electrons with $E_T > \unit{10}{\GeV}$ and $\mods{\eta} < 2.47$ are selected. Additionally, electrons with $1.37 < \mods{\eta} < 1.52$ are vetoed since they correspond
to the crack region (see \Section~\ref{sec:atlas:calo}).

\begin{figure}

	energy, simulated by a \pythia{6} sample of di-jet, heavy flavour, prompt photon, \PW 
	and \PZ processes \cite{ElectronPerf:Expect}. Non-isolated electrons are from heavy 
	flavour decay. Background electrons are from photon conversions. Isolated electrons 
	are prompt electrons from a \PW or \PZ boson, though appear below the y-axis range.}

\begin{description}
\item[Reconstruction] \hfill \\
	Energy deposits in \ac{ECal} cells are clustered by a \textit{sliding window} 
	algorithm \cite{ElectronPerf:Expect}. First, the calorimeter is divided into 
	\textit{towers} of size $\Delta\eta \times \Delta\phi = 0.025 \times 0.025$ (the 
	cell size of the middle layer). Then a window of $3 \times 5$ towers in $\eta$-$\phi$ 
	space scans the \ac{ECal} for local maxima with $E_T > \unit{2.5}{\GeV}$.

	Tracks within $\Delta R < 0.3$ of a cluster are then refit using a Gaussian Sum 
	Filter (GSF) \cite{Electron:GSF}. The default fit described in 
	\Section~\ref{sec:objects:tracks} uses a pion hypothesis to estimate material 
	effects, and does not account for the significant bremsstrahlung experienced by 
	electrons (which is highly $\eta$-dependent). The GSF is a non-linear fitter and 
	improves the accuracy of electron tracking by accounting for this.

	For a cluster to be reconstructed as an electron, it must be matched to a track. If a 
	track is within $\Delta\eta < 0.05$ and $\Delta\phi < 0.1 (0.05)$ of the cluster 
	centre, they are considered matched. The asymmetric $\Delta\phi$ requirement allows 
	for increased bending due to bremsstrahlung. When multiple tracks are matched, that 
	with the smallest $\Delta R$ is chosen.

	Finally, the cluster is rebuilt using a $3 \times 7$ ($5 \times 5$) sliding window 
	in the barrel (end-cap), and the electron four-momentum is defined 
	\cite{ElectronPerf:2010}. The direction is taken from the matched track and the 
	energy is the cluster energy, corrected for losses in passive material and leakage 
	outside the cluster. These simulated corrections depend on the longitudinal shower 
	shape and energy deposited in the presampler. The EM energy scale was calibrated
	using test beam and \textit{in situ} \HepProcess{\PZ \HepTo \Pe\Pe} measurements.

	The electron reconstruction performance is measured with a \textit{tag-and-probe} 
	method on \HepProcess{\PZ \HepTo \Pe\Pe} events \cite{ElectronPerf:2010,
	ElectronPerf:2012}, and is shown in \Figure~\ref{fig:objects:el_recoeff}. This 
	involves selecting an unbiased sample of events containing a well-identified 
	\textit{tag} object and a loosely-identified \textit{probe} object, and measuring the 
	selection efficiency of the probes. The sample must be clean (often enforced by a 
	mass constraint) and backgrounds estimated (usually from side-bands or a template).
	Here, the tag is a well-identified electron, the probe is an \ac{ECal} cluster, the 
	selection is the reconstruction algorithm and the mass constraint is 
	$\unit{80}{\GeV} < m_{\parenths{\text{tag, probe}}} < \unit{100}{\GeV}$.
\item[Identification] \hfill \\
	Electron identification is improved by applying cuts on track quality and shower 
	shape. There are three reference operating points called \textit{loose}, 
	\textit{medium} and \textit{tight}, with progressively greater background rejection 
	and lower signal efficiency.
	
	For $E_T > \unit{25}{\GeV}$ the medium criteria are used, comprising cuts on
	\begin{itemize}
		\item shower shape variables (lateral and longitudinal)
		\item leakage to the \ac{HCal}
		\item the number of pixel and \acs{SCT} hits
		\item the impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex
		\item track-cluster matching
		\item transition radiation
	\end{itemize}
	and additionally electrons with conversion vertices or without a hit in the first 
	pixel layer are vetoed (to suppress the \Wgamma background).
 
 	For $E_T < \unit{25}{\GeV}$ the \Wjets and QCD backgrounds are much larger. Thus a 
 	multivariate \textit{very tight likelihood} identification is used, with similar 
 	signal efficiency to the cut-based tight criteria but improved background rejection. 
 	It uses the signal and background probability density functions of multiple input 
 	variables to construct a likelihood discriminant, which may be cut upon (effectively 
 	choosing an operating point). The input variables are similar to those listed above, 
 	although track hits remain as cuts.
 
 	The electron identification performance is also measured using tag-and-probe of 
 	\HepProcess{\PZ \HepTo \Pe\Pe} events \cite{ElectronPerf:2010,ElectronPerf:2012}, 
 	and is shown in \Figure~\ref{fig:objects:el_ideff}.
\item[Isolation] \hfill \\
	Rejection of hadronic fakes or electrons from heavy flavour decays is improved by 
	requiring the electron to be isolated from activity in the tracker and calorimeter. 
	The cuts are summarised in \Table~\ref{tab:objects:el_iso} and explained below.

	\textit{Tracker isolation:} $p_T^{\text{cone}}\parenths{R_0}$ is the summed $p_T$ of 
	all tracks of $p_T > \unit{0.4}{\GeV}$ within a cone of $\Delta R = R_0$, excluding 
	the electron track itself. For robustness against pile-up, the tracks are required to 
	originate from the primary vertex.

	\textit{Calorimeter isolation:} Uncalibrated topological clusters (see 
	\Section~\ref{sec:objects:jets}) are built from energy deposits in the \ac{ECal} 
	and \ac{HCal}. These are more robust against pile-up than cell deposits as they 
	suppress noise. $E_T^{\text{cone}}\parenths{R_0}$ is the summed $E_T$ of the 
	topological clusters within a cone of $\Delta R = R_0$, excluding cells in a 
	$5 \times 7$ window around the electron (see \Figure~\ref{fig:objects:el_iso}). 
	Corrections are made for electron energy leakage and deposits from pile-up and the 
	underlying event.
\item[Primary vertex association] \hfill \\
	To associate the electron with the primary vertex, the transverse impact parameter 
	$d_0$ is required to be within three standard deviations of zero. Also, the 
	longitudinal impact parameter $z_0$ is constrained by $\mods{z_0 \sin\theta} < 
	\unit{0.4}{\milli\metre}$.
