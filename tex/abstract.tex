In the Standard Model of particle physics, the non-zero masses of the \PW and \PZ bosons and 
the fermions are generated through interactions with the Higgs field, excitations of which 
correspond to Higgs bosons. Thus, the experimental discovery of the Higgs boson is of prime 
importance to the field, and would confirm our understanding of fundamental mass generation.

This thesis describes a search for the \ggHWWlvlv process of Higgs boson production and decay.
It uses the LHC Run~I dataset of \pp collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector, which 
corresponds to an integrated luminosity of \unit{4.5}{\invfb} at \unit{$\sqrt{s} = 7$}{\TeV} 
and \unit{20.3}{\invfb} at \unit{$\sqrt{s} = 8$}{\TeV}. An excess of events is observed, 
consistent with Higgs boson production, with a significance of 5.3 standard deviations at 
\unit{$\mH = 125$}{\GeV}. The measured signal strength is \statsyst{1.14}{0.20}{0.20} at 
\unit{$\mH = 125$}{\GeV}. A cross section measurement of \WW production, a major background 
to this search, is also presented using the \unit{$\sqrt{s} = 7$}{\TeV} dataset only.
